  <h2><strong>Our Story</strong></h2>
  <h3>Meeting</h3>
  Cristi and Dave met over ten years ago at the Presidential Scholars recognition week in Washington D.C., during the summer of 2003. They had just graduated from high school and been accepted to Brown University. Though they were both dating other people at the time, they had an immediate respect for each others' intelligence and curiosity about the world, and became friends. <br />
  <br />
  At Brown the following fall, Cristi and Dave lived in the same freshman dorm building, and played poker and Settlers of Catan together with their friends. Cristi especially knew very few people entering Brown, and was always happy to see Dave's familiar face! <br />
  <br />
  Dave studied computer science, advancing in the department and making many life-long friends, including all three of his groomsmen. Cristi deepened her love of language, choosing linguistics as a major, and writing for the College Hill Independent. At the end of sophomore year, their disparate groups of friends brought them back together by bringing them to rush events at Alpha Delta Phi, a coed fraternity. When they saw each other at these events, they both thought the same thing: "If a reasonable person like Dave/Cristi is doing this, it must be OK!", and so tricked themselves into pledging. <br />
  <br />
  <h3>Alpha Delta Phi</h3>
  At Alpha Delta Phi, they had the opportunity to work together in new ways on events and as officers. Dave admired Cristi's creativity and fun-loving spirit, and Cristi was especially impressed by Dave's leadership qualities when he was elected president. It wasn't long before Groomsman Bill would declare her 'first lady'. <br />
  <br />
  In the spring of their senior year, when they were finally both single at the same time, Dave revealed to a mutual friend that he had a crush on Cristi. Coincidentally, Cristi revealed to the same friend that she couldn't imagine ever finding a more loyal and honest man than Dave. Beans were spilled, and within a few weeks, Cristi had knocked on Dave's dorm room door, and declared her feelings, which Dave heard with measured, thoughtful demeanor. She left, sure that she had ruined their long-standing friendship. Fifteen agonizing minutes later, Dave appeared at <em>her</em> door, and declared that he felt the same way! <br />
  <br />
  This might have been 'happily ever after' except that Dave was ready to move to San Francisco to take a job at Sun Microsystems, while Cristi was returning home to Oklahoma City to take an internship at Oklahoma Today magazine. <br />
  <br />
  <h3>After College</h3>
  They decided to spend the first two weeks of that summer of 2007 driving across the country to situate Dave in San Francisco. If 39,000 miles together didn't drive them apart, nothing could. They pulled into San Francisco two weeks later, and parked on Fair Oaks street, a few blocks from the apartment Dave would share with Stephanie, Adam, and Bill. The great success of that road trip further cemented Dave and Cristi's feelings that they could live together, work together, and do anything together. But they were headed different directions. <br />
  <br />
  During the long six months of her internship, Dave and Cristi broke up. They tried to avoid meddling in each other's new lives, but couldn't stay out of touch for long. Abandoning her long-held assumption that she would return to the East Coast to look for a full-time job, Cristi decided that Dave outweighed the entire New York publishing world, and set out to look for jobs in the City by the Bay. <br />
  <br />
  In late 2007, both a job and an apartment materialized in San Francisco, and Cristi was off on another road trip, this time just one way. <br />
  <br />
  Since then, Dave and Cristi have both lived and worked happily in San Francisco. In summer 2008, they moved in together on the same little street where they'd found parking so long ago. Their apartment on Fair Oaks has seen lots of birthday, New Year's Eve, and Giants viewing parties, and made them realize they didn't want anything more than to continue living together for the rest of their lives. <br />
  <br />
  <h3>Proposal</h3>
  In the fall of 2013, they admitted to each other that they wanted to get married. Dave started shopping around for rings, and Cristi set up a wedding <a href="http://www.pinterest.com/claquer/wedding-stuff/">Pinterest page</a>. As fall ended, Dave suggested they go out at sunset, as they had done many times before, for Cristi to sketch and Dave to photograph the landscape. They agreed on Bernal Hill, but a holiday party prevented them from going in the evening. Cristi unwittingly suggested sunrise instead. <br />
  <br />
  On the morning of Saturday, December 12, they got up extremely early and drove to Bernal Hill in San Francisco. Cristi considered that Dave might be up to something, but his calm, measured demeanor belied his surprising intentions. When they got up the hill, Cristi took out her oil pastels and started sketching the landscape, and shooed Dave off to take photos. He came back a few minutes later and began to talk about the city, and all they had been through to get here together. Cristi started to tear up. Dave kneeled down, produced a ring box, and asked Cristi to marry him. She started nodding and crying, and didn't manage to actually say 'yes' until Dave repeatedly asked for confirmation. <br />
  <br />
  They spent the rest of the morning drinking the champagne Dave had hidden on the hill the night before, and calling their families, who mostly asked what had taken so long.
